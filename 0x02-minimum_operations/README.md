# Minimum Operations Project

## Overview
For this project, you will need to understand several key algorithmic and mathematical concepts to devise a solution that efficiently calculates the minimum number of operations to achieve a given number of characters using only “Copy All” and “Paste” operations.

## Concepts Needed
### Dynamic Programming
Familiarity with dynamic programming can help in breaking down the problem into simpler subproblems and building up the solution.

## Requirements
### General
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.4.3)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should be documented
- Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
- All your files must be executable

## Project Structure
```

```

### Sample Usage
```sh
$ ./0-minoperations.py 12
7
```

## How to Execute
To execute the program, use the following command:
```sh
./0-minoperations.py <number>
```
Replace `<number>` with the target number of characters.

## Notes
- Ensure that your code is well-documented and follows the PEP 8 style guide.
- Make sure all your scripts are executable.
